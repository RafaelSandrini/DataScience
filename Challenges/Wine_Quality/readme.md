## Wine Quality

This dataset I found on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).
The exercise to verify the wine's quality, I did while I was watching a live from [Let's Code](https://letscode.com.br/)

### Problem Statement
*Two datasets are included, related to red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal.*

### Task

*These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.*
*The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).*
*Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines.*
*Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.*
   
### Dataset Description
*dataset.csv: 4898 x 12*

### Challenge
*The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.*
