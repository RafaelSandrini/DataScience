## House Prices

This challenge is an exercise from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

### Problem Statement
*Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.*
*But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.*

### Task
*With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.*

### Dataset Description
  - *train.csv - the training set*
  - *test.csv - the test set*
  - *data_description.txt - full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here*
  - *sample_submission.csv - a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms*

### Challenge
*To predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. *
